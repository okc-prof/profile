# About Me | My self-summery
Me. Always. At all times → 🤔🔍🤔
　

A slice of my world-view:

There's no such thing as overthinking;
"Why/How?" all day, every day;
and the (non-)answers "Because." and "It just is/does." got no one anywhere, ever.

INTP

# Aspirations | Current goal
I'm of myriad, concurrent goals; got goals for days and goals on goals –metagoals? higher-order goals? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Here's one…

To get a mixed design studio rollin'.
If you're the entrepreneurial, design/art/engineering, and/or programming/coding sort and're up for a project, let's work on something dope; the more, the merrier. Hmu about all things design, business, and CS.

Oh yeah, as of late, I've been wanting to learn how to work on cars (body work, upholstery, mechanical, all of it –full restoration type stuff). I've a particular interest in 80s/90s kei vans; though, I'll start with whatever. If you've got something in pieces in your garage, I'll happily lend a hand.

日本語 (Japanese), too! Getting better at it is a goal. I frequently study and practice (though, I haven't been for long) and'd be glad to do so with anyone interested.

# Talent | I could probably beat you at
being the farthest left.
